                <p>Hey Mom — I wish I could give you the world today. I can't move much, but my heart is with you every
                    second. Thank you for everything you do.</p>

                <p>You taught me kindness, patience, and how to laugh when things get tough. I'm learning everyday
                    because
                    of you. Tonight, let's just celebrate you — your warmth, your smile, and the millions of small
                    things
                    you do without asking for anything back.</p>

                <p>Love,</p>
                <p>Rutuj, Kshitij</p>

                <p>Mom, you’re the light that never fades,
                The calm in storms, the shade in blaze.
                Your love’s a song — so soft, so true,
                Every note reminds me of you.</p>

                <p>You heal with words, with gentle eyes,
                You lift my heart where hope still lies.
                When days feel cold or dreams seem far,
                You’re still my sky, my northern star.</p>

                <p>Your laughter warms the walls we share,
                It turns the silence into care.
                Through every scar and every smile,
                You’ve walked beside me all the while.</p>

                <p>No jewel can shine, no gold can pay,
                For what your love gives every day.
                So here’s my heart, in verse and hue —
                The best of me begins with you. ❤️</p>
